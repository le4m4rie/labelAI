Some code for my thesis **Implementation and evaluation of an object detection system for item number labels**.

The project includes:

Data modifications like data augmentation.

Evaluation of the object detector with NMS, IoU and True Positive and False Positive rates as well as ROC curves for visualization.

Hyperparameter optimization with Bayesian optimization.

Deployment of an OCR library to read text on the detected object.

And many other experiments!

The project is based on the **Viola and Jones algorithm**: [link to paper](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~efros/courses/AP06/Papers/viola-cvpr-01.pdf).
